# Architecture Center

The architecture center is a reference for solution engineers, architects, and DevOps people who want to integrate Okta into their systems. Here, you'll find tutorials to incorporate "reference architectures" into Docker-based systems so you can see how to apply RAs to your own systems. You'll also discover how existing customers have  integrated Okta workforce solutions into their systems by applying these reference architectures themselves.

> **Note:** Please leave feedback on the content and format of the architecture center by posting comments in the [Architecture area of the developer forums](https://devforum.okta.com/c/questions/architecture/24).

## Reference Architectures

These reference architectures describe different problem scenarios your systems may face and how Okta can help. The goal of these scenarios is to walk you through the implementation process from beginning to end.

## Case Studies

These case studies demonstrate how Okta customers took and applied the tenets of a reference architecture and implemented it into their own systems.
